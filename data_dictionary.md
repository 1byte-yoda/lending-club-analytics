### Data Source Understanding
The data can be downloaded / scraped directly from [Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action).
In this project, I downloaded the data from [data.world](https://data.world/jaypeedevlin/lending-club-loan-data-2007-11), and there were 2 files â€“ data dictionary and the loan data itself.
